Welcome to the Playback Help Page!

As a reminder each input must contain only a single command, with the arguments separated by a "|".
This means that your playlist and song names should not contain a "|".

Here are the list of commands supported:

Navigating the UI:
- exit : returns to the main interface and removes the last song played from queue
- pbhelp : displays this help page

Playback:
- pause : pauses the curent song
- resume : resumes the current song
- skip : skips the current song
- setv|volume : sets the volume to the double volume. Please use a value between 0.0 and 1.0
